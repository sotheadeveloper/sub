00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:06.919

<i>Citing rising tensions

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.366
<i>scientists have moved
the Doomsday Clock</i>

<i>to 60 seconds to midnight.</i>

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:23.371
<i>Are we truly so close
to nuclear annihilation?</i>

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.851
<i>But first, we ask
the average citizen,</i>

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.766
<i>"Is America ready for war?"</i>

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.420
<i>So</i> The Gazette

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.205
<i>has this nuclear-attack
procedure article.</i>

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.771
<i>It says dead family members

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.382
<i>in garbage bags</i>

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:36.340
<i>and placed outside
for collection.</i>

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:38.560
<i>It sounds like
America getting ready for war</i>

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.736
<i>means Americans
getting ready to die.</i>

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.999
<i>Getting ready to die.</i>

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.204
It's beautiful work.

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:43.946
I hope that ship
keeps it properly refrigerated

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.252
on its voyage.

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:46.775
If it decays--

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.951
It's plenty cold
where it's headed.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.301
After two years
on this godforsaken island

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:52.781
creating the thing,
he'll make sure

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:55.305
it doesn't spoil
before the big reveal.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.394
But, Ms. Manish,

00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:59.831
I thought you'd be glad to see
the back of that damn thing,

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:01.833
not sketching the front.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:03.618
Well, Mr. Shea,

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.707
I just wanted
some final sketches

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.361
of the facial assembly,

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:10.102
especially that amazing
beak structure.

00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.756
"Amazing"?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.150
You sound like
the scientists down there.

00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:16.500
So caught up
in their own accomplishment,

00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:19.590
blind to the horror
of this monstrosity

00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:21.070
we dreamed up,

00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:24.726
this nightmare they made real.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.423
For one man's vision,

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:28.295
we've all gone through hell
and back.

00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:31.211
But can we go back?

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:35.389
Think he'll let us off
this island?

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:37.521
We signed
the non-disclosure agreement,

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:39.436
we've been well compensated.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.570
And our ship to the mainland
will be here in a few days.

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:44.833
Why such dark thoughts, Max?

00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:47.488
Oh, well, yeah.
I'm sure you're right.

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.141
I guess in all this business,

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.448
there are more than a few
uncomfortable parallels

00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:53.885
to an old comic book story
I wrote.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:04:01.632
A vile little yarn from
<i>Tales of The Black Freighter.</i>

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:03.939
<i>Adrift and starving,</i>

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:08.030
<i>my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked,</i>

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:11.990
<i>spilling from brain to heart
like black ink.</i>

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:13.253
Taxi!

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.040
<i>I imagine Davidstown</i>

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:22.087
<i>overrun by</i> The Freighter's
<i>tattooed fiends.</i>

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.482
<i>My wife was almost
certainly dead.</i>

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:28.398
<i>I remembered her
and my beautiful daughters</i>

00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:30.705
<i>waving goodbye
from the verandah.</i>

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.750
<i>Glad my Rosa
ain't alive to see this.</i>

00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:34.448
<i>All now dead.</i>

00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.493
Everything's going to hell.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.408
- Look at this. Look at this...
- Mm.

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:39.844
<i>I imagined</i>

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:41.672
<i>my shipmates'
bloated corpses...</i>

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:43.370
<i>Doc Manhattan
leaves the planet...</i>

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.067
<i>...and the putrefying shark...</i>

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:46.982
<i>Russians
on the warpath.</i>

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.201
<i>...carrying
my raft to oblivion.</i>

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.465
- Ozymandias attacked...
-  <i>All dead.</i>

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.162
I tell ya.

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:54.772
It all reads like headlines
from ten years ago,

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:57.601
before they banned
all the masked avengers in '77.

00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:00.517
Hey, speaking of,
you see this Rorschach item?

00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:02.954
They finally caught him
last week.

00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:06.436
Turns out
he was a customer here, huh?

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.962
Ror-- I mean, Walter Kovacs?
Interesting.

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.268
Incredible, right?

00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:13.443
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:14.792
Makes you wonder

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:18.318
what makes a guy
like Rorschach tick?

00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:20.755
Could probably go off
at any second.

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.975
<i>Faced with
horrors both intolerable</i>

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:25.499
<i>and unavoidable,</i>

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:30.373
<i>I chose madness.</i>

00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.055
Hey, settle it down.

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:03.667
Hey, Rorschach.

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:06.496
You're pretty famous
around here.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.108
I'd sure like
to get your autograph.

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:11.719
I got a pen right here.

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.290
Get that asshole! Kill him!

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.075
Come here, you son of a...

00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:23.252
Get him!

00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:27.430
Rip this guy apart!

00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:28.736
It's payback time,
Rorschach.

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.043
Kill him!

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.523
Enough, Kovacs.

00:06:33.697 --> 00:06:34.785
Down on the ground!

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:36.570
Got him pinned!
Call for backup.

00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:37.962
This place is about to explode.

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.529
Get that motherfucker!

00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:40.400
You're dead, Rorschach. Dead!

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:42.053
None of you understand.

00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:44.491
I'm not locked up
in here with you.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:46.623
You're locked up
in here with me.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.830
Dan?

00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:23.094
Uh, Dan?

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.749
Dan, are you down here?

00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:37.282
Oh, my...

00:07:38.936 --> 00:07:39.894
Wow.

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:05.441
Whoa!

00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:07.661
Shit!

00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:11.882
- Laurie? Laurie? Laurie!
-  Dan!

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:13.362
- Laurie?
- Dan!

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.059
- Laurie!
- Dan!

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:16.060
Jesus!

00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:17.584
Hold on.

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:23.720
Laurie,
are you okay?

00:08:23.894 --> 00:08:25.156
I am so sorry.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.506
I was looking for you,
and... and...

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.376
No, no. I was...
I was just in the...

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.899
Are you... are you okay?

00:08:29.073 --> 00:08:30.771
I think I accidentally
hit a button in your...

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.381
I was... I was just tinkering
with <i>Archie</i> earlier,

00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:34.252
- and I left him on...
- I'm sorry. <i>Archie?</i>

00:08:34.426 --> 00:08:35.776
Yeah.
The Owl Ship.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.213
It doesn't... it doesn't--
Are you hurt?

00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.215
Really...

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:41.869
- Oh.
-  I'm fine.

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:43.871
Sorry. Um...

00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:46.438
I've-- Well...
I've been a little...

00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:49.006
on edge lately.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.965
I wasn't going to say it.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:53.010
I mean, since you've been
letting me live here all week.

00:08:53.184 --> 00:08:54.490
But, yeah,

00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:55.970
you've been
jumping at shadows.

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.580
I guess I didn't want
to talk about it.

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:01.279
It's just...

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:03.412
After the Comedian died,

00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:06.981
Jon, Adrian, and Rorschach
were attacked within days.

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:08.939
I'm starting to worry--

00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:11.681
You're not taking Rorschach's
mask-killer nonsense seriously,

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:13.857
- are you?
-  Well, um...

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:16.294
Oh, no.

00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:24.738
Oh, Dan. I'm so sorry.

00:09:24.912 --> 00:09:26.870
No, no. It's... it's fine.

00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:32.572
Had some good times
in this suit, but...

00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:35.444
those times went up in smoke
a long time ago.

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:36.967
You miss those times?

00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:38.795
Nah.

00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:41.232
Looking back, it was all just
embarrassing, really.

00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.105
A school kid's fantasy.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:51.765
Well, at least you were
living out your own fantasies.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.550
I was living out my mother's.

00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:58.815
Well, in a way, I mean,
my dreams were kind of forged

00:09:58.989 --> 00:10:01.165
by the adventures
of the Minutemen.

00:10:01.339 --> 00:10:02.950
I idolized Hollis,

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:05.953
which defied
my father's plans for me.

00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:07.824
Ooh! Do tell.

00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:12.394
Well... Dad was pushing me
to follow him into banking,

00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.352
but I preferred
keeping scorecards

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.790
on crime fighters
over currency.

00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:20.707
Still, he kept me focused,
and I made it into Harvard.

00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:25.363
I was majoring in aeronautics
and zoology when he died.

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:28.497
And he left me
with a lot of money.

00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:30.499
With no one around
to talk me out of it,

00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:32.936
this happened.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.678
You made your dreams real.

00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:37.332
A dream made real

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:40.248
just becomes another
messy reality, doesn't it?

00:10:40.422 --> 00:10:41.945
But, yeah,

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:45.645
when I was in the moment,
I made it my own.

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:47.777
I think we both
made it our own.

00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:57.744
See that souvenir case?

00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.659
I was keeping my own scorecard

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.400
separate from Hollis'
Nite Owl adventures.

00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:05.621
I was writing
my own future history.

00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:10.713
Well, I couldn't wait to ditch
all that stuff

00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.541
from my adventuring days.

00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:15.718
As you can probably tell,
my two boxes of belongings

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:18.460
that just arrived
from the Rockefeller eviction.

00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:19.983
Honestly, I'm surprised
they bothered

00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:22.899
to send me anything
after... our separation.

00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:26.424
Do you miss Jon?

00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:28.688
I keep thinking I should.

00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:33.170
Even when I was with him,
he was never really there

00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:34.650
unlike all
the government agents

00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:36.130
keeping tabs on us.

00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:39.089
On how I kept Jon happy.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.009
But, hey, I could only dream
about what you've got here.

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.533
You're lucky to be on your own
with your privacy intact.

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:50.797
Yeah...

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.234
Lucky.

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:55.410
Just another
messy reality, huh?

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.412
Is there any other kind?

00:11:58.674 --> 00:11:59.936
And these days it feels like

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.157
reality is crashing down
around us all.

00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:05.420
Now you sound
like Rorschach again.

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:08.379
Dan, his mask-killer theory
doesn't hold up.

00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:10.338
Jon left Earth
of his own free will.

00:12:10.512 --> 00:12:13.167
Rorschach was caught red-handed
committing murder.

00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:14.777
Where's the conspiracy?

00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.562
It's not like Rorschach
to just shoot someone.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.738
Too easy.

00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:20.217
And those events
timed so closely

00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:21.871
to the attack on Adrian

00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:23.960
and the murder of the Comedian,
too coincidental.

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:26.615
Rorschach was on to it
from day one.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.098
Look, I know that mask
has eaten his brains

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:32.316
over the years,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.491
but we worked together.

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:34.928
Rorschach was always

00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:36.581
a brilliant investigator
and tactician.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.322
So, I can't help but wonder

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:42.239
if he found any evidence
that links all these events.

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.546
I just wish I could find out
what's in his head.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:49.464
Okay, Walter.

00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:51.205
Now, I guess you know
what this is?

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:53.729
I want you to look at it
and tell me what you see.

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.341
Will you look at it, Walter?

00:12:58.342 --> 00:12:59.953
Will you do that for me?

00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:01.258
What can you see?

00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:07.003
A pretty bird.

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:09.092
That's great.

00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:10.311
Let's try another, shall we?

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.401
What do you see?

00:13:20.277 --> 00:13:22.714
- A pretty butterfly.
- Wonderful, Walter.

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:25.717
This is going so well
for our first session.

00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:27.284
This really helps me to speak

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:29.112
to your psychological fitness
for your trial.

00:13:30.113 --> 00:13:31.071
Let's keep going.

00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:34.814
What do you see on this card?

00:13:35.858 --> 00:13:37.294
And feel free to describe

00:13:37.468 --> 00:13:39.166
all the images
that come to mind.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.386
Oh, yes!

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.519
Hey! Get lost, you little shit!

00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:46.913
He ain't paying
to see your ugly face.

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:48.828
Where are you going, whoreson?

00:13:49.002 --> 00:13:50.264
Don't touch him!

00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:52.135
Son of a bitch
probably got diseases.

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:53.528
That true, whoreson--

00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:56.139
Get off!

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.971
Well, Walter?

00:14:02.145 --> 00:14:03.538
What do you make of it?

00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:05.061
You keep calling me Walter.

00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:07.150
I don't like you.

00:14:07.324 --> 00:14:09.979
Uh...
you don't like me?

00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:11.676
Fat, wealthy.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.722
Think you understand pain.

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:15.637
I'll tell you
about pain, Doctor.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:16.638
I'll tell you about...

00:14:17.508 --> 00:14:19.728
Rorschach.

00:14:19.902 --> 00:14:21.730
Born by the mistake
of a whore,

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.688
ward of state by age ten.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:28.519
After mother was murdered,
only one childhood regret.

00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:30.739
Not being there
to spit on her remains.

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:35.700
<i>Became manual worker
in garment industry,</i>

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.398
<i>received special order
for a dress</i>

00:14:37.572 --> 00:14:40.575
<i>in new Doctor Manhattan
spin-off fabric.</i>

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:43.447
<i>Viscous fluids
between latex layers,</i>

00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:45.580
<i>heat and pressure sensitive.</i>

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:49.062
<i>Customer, Kitty Genovese,
never collected order.</i>

00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:50.890
<i>Didn't know why.</i>

00:14:51.064 --> 00:14:54.197
<i>Black and white,
changing shape but not mixing.</i>

00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:55.807
<i>No gray.</i>

00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.549
<i>Very, very beautiful.</i>

00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:02.379
<i>Next day, learned
Kitty Genovese was murdered.</i>

00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:04.991
<i>Raped and killed
outside her own apartment.</i>

00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.515
<i>Nearly 40 neighbors
heard screams.</i>

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.562
<i>Nobody did anything.
Nobody called cops.</i>

00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:13.216
<i>Some of them even watched.</i>

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.783
<i>They watched!</i>

00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:16.741
<i>That's when I knew
what people were</i>

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.961
<i>behind all the self-deception.</i>

00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:23.966
<i>Ashamed for humanity,
I went home.</i>

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.229
<i>Took Kitty's unwanted dress</i>

00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:27.883
<i>and made a face
I could bear to look at</i>

00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:28.971
<i>in the mirror.</i>

00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:33.889
<i>1975, worked kidnap case.</i>

00:15:34.063 --> 00:15:38.328
<i>Blair Roache. Six years old.</i>

00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:39.808
<i>Questioned informants.</i>

00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.549
<i>One bled answers.</i>

00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:43.072
<i>An address.</i>

00:15:43.246 --> 00:15:44.944
<i>Disused dressmaker's
in Brooklyn.</i>

00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:51.776
<i>I was just Kovacs, then.
Pretending to be Rorschach.</i>

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.867
<i>Naive. Soft.
Didn't understand.</i>

00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:58.522
<i>Until I found her.</i>

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:04.267
<i>Nothing left but pieces.
Ashes in stove.</i>

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:09.533
<i>Blood on chopping block.
Bones for dogs.</i>

00:16:09.707 --> 00:16:11.100
<i>She was consumed by evil.</i>

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.279
<i>Never had a chance.
Neither did Kovacs.</i>

00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:19.326
<i>Finally understanding
man's true capacity for horror,</i>

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.458
<i>Kovacs closed his eyes.</i>

00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:25.941
<i>It was Rorschach
who opened them again.</i>

00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:34.167
<i>Put dogs down easy.
They didn't know better.</i>

00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:39.520
<i>Gerald Grice did.</i>

00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:41.957
What-- No. Hey!

00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:43.437
<i>Put him down hard.</i>

00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:45.004
I told you I didn't
do nothing to that girl.

00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:47.702
You have nothing on me.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.312
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:51.053
What is this?

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:52.663
Don't bother
sawing through handcuffs.

00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:55.449
- Never make it in time.
- Oh, my God. You're crazy!

00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:57.016
What... what,
you're gonna burn me?

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.019
You can't do this.
Stop! No! Oh, God! No!

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.546
No! No!

00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:11.160
<i>Once a man
has seen,</i>

00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:13.119
<i>he can never
turn his back on it,</i>

00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:15.251
<i>never pretend
it doesn't exist,</i>

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:17.732
no matter who orders him
to look away.

00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:20.691
I do not do this thing
because it is permitted.

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:23.520
I do it because I have to.

00:17:23.694 --> 00:17:26.480
I do it because I am compelled.

00:17:27.872 --> 00:17:31.050
I... I see.

00:17:31.224 --> 00:17:33.748
No. You don't.

00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:35.228
But have patience, Doctor.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.230
You will.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.539
How does Adrian do it?

00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:46.065
He's barely older than I am,
but he's in better shape now

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:49.024
than I ever was
in my Nite Owl days.

00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:52.288
Back when he retired
from being Ozymandias,

00:17:52.462 --> 00:17:56.553
he had me and Jon up to visit
his Grand Antarctic retreat.

00:17:56.727 --> 00:17:58.251
Such a show-off.

00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:00.992
You visited Karnak?
Did... did you see Bubastis?

00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:02.559
Yeah. He sent me off

00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:04.039
to go play with his
overgrown house cat.

00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:06.433
Genetically modified lynx, actually.

00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.348
Fascinating.

00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:12.743
The only fascination there
was between Jon and Adrian.

00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:13.875
They talked endlessly.

00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:19.098
He uses
his Veidt Enterprises fortune

00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:20.447
to advance science.

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.536
- Nauseating.
- And fund charities.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.538
He makes it seem so easy.

00:18:24.712 --> 00:18:28.063
He retired from one fantasy
and just... built another.

00:18:28.237 --> 00:18:32.067
He was... just born
with the answer

00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:35.897
that no money or power
or a family can give you.

00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:37.290
Answer to what?

00:18:37.464 --> 00:18:39.030
After taking off the mask,

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:41.511
who are you?

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:47.300
Well, here's to Adrian,
the man with the answers.

00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:48.257
Ugh.

00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:53.001
Hey, what...
what's in your pocket?

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:56.700
Oh, I, uh...
rescued these from the fire.

00:18:56.874 --> 00:18:58.876
My spare Owl Goggles.
Where were they?

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.705
In, uh... <i>Archie.</i>

00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:04.752
- <i>Archie?
- Well, nice that you two</i>
are so familiar

00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:07.320
after teaming up
to destroy my secret lair.

00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:12.412
Here. Try them on.
Experience my Owl Vision.

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.283
No matter how black it gets,

00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:17.417
when you look through these,
everything is clear as day.

00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:20.724
Why, Mr. Dreiberg...

00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:22.204
You're ravishing.

00:19:22.378 --> 00:19:24.337
Oh, they must be broken.
Let me look...

00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:45.053
I can't get the-- No,
got it. Sorry.

00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.936
I'm... so sorry. It's not you.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.156
- It's just...
- Hey, relax. It's okay.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.637
- No, you deserve better.
- Dan...

00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:06.857
- I mean, I really want this.
- It doesn't matter.

00:20:07.031 --> 00:20:09.512
I know how it is
when something's not right.

00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.037
We'll just sleep now. Okay?

00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:18.042
Just sleep.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:19.957
<i>Coming up
on the eleven o'clock news.</i>

00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:22.699
<i>Russian forces
push further into Afghanistan.</i>

00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:25.572
<i>And Pakistan calls on the US
to intervene,</i>

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:28.966
<i>but Russia claims to be
merely securing her borders.</i>

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.448
<i>We also have a special report
on noted author Max Shea,</i>

00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:35.103
<i>who mysteriously vanished
two years ago.</i>

00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:37.279
<i>Hear why investigators'
search for clues</i>

00:20:37.453 --> 00:20:38.802
<i>has ended in failure.</i>

00:21:48.655 --> 00:21:50.396
Well, well, well.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.223
Hey there, Rorschach.

00:21:52.398 --> 00:21:54.400
It's been a long time.

00:21:54.574 --> 00:21:56.619
Big Figure. Small world.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.710
"Small world." I like that.

00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.887
You know, after 20 years,

00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:05.324
I guess you thought
you could forget about

00:22:05.498 --> 00:22:06.629
what you did to me.

00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:09.545
You and that fucking Owl guy.

00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:10.938
Funny how these things

00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:12.983
come back to haunt us
though, huh?

00:22:13.157 --> 00:22:16.160
Speaking of, that guy
you burned is dying.

00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:21.514
Maybe tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:25.082
But see, he had
lots of friends around here.

00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:26.736
And when he dies,

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.131
this place blows
and then you die...

00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:32.481
by inches.

00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:33.743
Tall order.

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:35.310
Smart ass!

00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:36.311
Gonna tear this guy
a new hole right now.

00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:38.618
Hey, hey, hey. No hurry.

00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:40.794
I've waited 20 years.

00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:45.146
He'll get his soon enough.
And nobody's gonna care.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.236
I hear even his shrink
resigned today.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.631
You're alone in the valley
of the shadow, Rorschach,

00:22:51.805 --> 00:22:54.373
where your past
has a long reach.

00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:57.376
And the only thing
between you and it

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.683
is one... crummy... lock.

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:02.772
Think about it.

00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:23.489
You okay?

00:23:23.663 --> 00:23:27.580
Bad dreams.
Bad realities.

00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.930
I hope it's not
what happened earlier.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.455
It's the mask-killer thing.

00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:35.849
Four of us taken down,

00:23:36.023 --> 00:23:38.199
war looming on the horizon,

00:23:38.373 --> 00:23:41.202
I'm... terrified
it's all connected

00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:42.769
and the worst
is yet to come.

00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:46.468
And I can't do anything
to stop it.

00:23:46.642 --> 00:23:49.645
It all just
makes me feel so...

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:52.953
so... impotent.

00:23:54.563 --> 00:23:56.260
So, I ran down here.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.827
For all the good that did.

00:23:58.001 --> 00:23:59.176
It's not like
taking the ship out

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.613
can set things straight.

00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:03.920
Why not?

00:24:05.748 --> 00:24:07.184
You're serious?

00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:10.840
I used to be a masked
avenger too, remember.

00:24:11.014 --> 00:24:12.320
I'm used to going out
at 3:00 in the morning

00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:13.974
and doing something stupid.

00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:24.550
Wait, I... I burned
your suit, remember?

00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.685
Spare goggles,
spare suit.

00:24:42.437 --> 00:24:43.612
- Dan?
- Mm-hm?

00:24:52.621 --> 00:24:53.622
I'm ready.

00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:03.937
Let's go.

00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:05.504
Hope we don't get caught.

00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:31.486
Whoa!

00:25:57.947 --> 00:26:01.603
This is great.
Really great.

00:26:04.693 --> 00:26:06.173
Dan, trouble on your right.

00:26:08.262 --> 00:26:09.089
Hold on!

00:26:20.143 --> 00:26:21.928
Building looks clear.

00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:23.103
No, wait.

00:26:23.277 --> 00:26:24.060
- There!
- Somebody, please!

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.238
Looks like four adults.
Can we pick them up?

00:26:28.412 --> 00:26:29.326
Already on it!

00:26:34.854 --> 00:26:36.072
<i>Please stay calm.</i>

00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:37.726
<i>We're here to rescue you.</i>

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.249
<i>Step back from the window.</i>

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.389
<i>Madre de Dios!</i>

00:26:48.563 --> 00:26:50.130
Mother of God is right.

00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:52.567
Oh, I'm an entirely
different Spectre.

00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.830
And certainly
nobody's mother.

00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:56.136
<i>Vamonos, por favor.</i>

00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:58.007
Let's go.

00:26:58.181 --> 00:26:59.879
-  <i>Gracias.</i>
-  Thanks.

00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:07.451
- Welcome aboard.
-  Hey!

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.279
You're that... Owl guy.

00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:10.193
Who?

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:11.847
Dark Owl!

00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:14.023
Who wants to hear
some music?

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.475
Oh!

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.216
<i>- Salud.</i>
- Thanks.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.478
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.958
What the hell just happened?

00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:41.442
Did that just happen?

00:27:41.616 --> 00:27:42.922
You do know
they might lock us up

00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:43.966
with Rorschach for this.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.489
Yeah.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.404
And World War III
might start tomorrow.

00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:16.259
Dan!

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:18.348
- Tonight was good.
- It was.

00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:22.613
I'd hoped tonight might wake
something inside you.

00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:23.702
Oh, it did.

00:28:26.313 --> 00:28:28.837
Insatiable, huh?

00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:31.971
So, what should we do next?

00:28:35.539 --> 00:28:38.760
We... should spring Rorschach.

00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:40.849
What?

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.985
<i>In my ravings,</i>

00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:48.074
<i>desperate for company,</i>

00:28:48.248 --> 00:28:52.034
<i>I conversed
with my perished shipmates.</i>

00:28:52.208 --> 00:28:55.908
<i>Their voices spoke
from beneath the raft.</i>

00:28:56.082 --> 00:29:00.086
<i>The conversation
of the dead, dreary...</i>

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.740
Oh, man.
Ten days to nuclear war, Derf.

00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:03.219
<i>- ...bitter.</i>
- That's what they said on TV.

00:29:03.393 --> 00:29:04.743
<i>...endlessly sad.</i>

00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:07.746
Oh, Jesus, Derf,
just get me some Katies,

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.617
so I can get high, man.

00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:12.228
<i>Interminable
bad news from mouths</i>

00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.753
<i>wherein the little fishes dart.</i>

00:29:14.927 --> 00:29:16.972
It's that Manhattan guy
who brought this down on us.

00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:19.670
Oh! The new papers
just arrived.

00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:21.281
There's a riot at the prison.

00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:23.500
- Give me that!
- Whoa! Hey!

00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:25.111
We got friends there.

00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:27.591
"Vigilante sparks prison riot.
Five dead."

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.158
Rorschach again.

00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:30.594
Making headlines

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.379
after some other heroes
made the news

00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:33.641
for the tenement fire rescue.

00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:35.034
Goddamn masks!

00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:36.557
Come on.
Let's round up the guys.

00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:38.472
There's gonna be hell
to pay for this.

00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:41.780
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say it was all connected.

00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:43.129
<i>We talked together,</i>

00:29:43.303 --> 00:29:45.218
<i>my rotted fellows and I</i>

00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:46.959
<i>of life...</i>

00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:48.656
<i>A news vendor
senses these things.</i>

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.918
<i>...and endings...</i>

00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.964
<i>It all spells trouble.</i>

00:29:52.138 --> 00:29:54.270
<i>...of the terrible sentence</i>

00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.185
<i>upon us all.</i>

00:29:59.449 --> 00:30:02.278
We'll get murdered in the chaos
by cops or criminals.

00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:04.541
- Either way--
- No, wait. Look.

00:30:04.715 --> 00:30:06.413
We'd already planned
on distracting the guards.

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:08.719
The prison riot
does the job for us.

00:30:08.894 --> 00:30:10.547
I can tune into
police radio chatter,

00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:11.897
and we'll get
up-to-the-minute intel

00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:13.855
on positions and strategies.

00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.465
This is our ticket inside.

00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:17.337
He is a homicidal maniac

00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:21.123
you hope will validate
this long-shot theory of yours.

00:30:23.082 --> 00:30:25.258
Is busting out Rorschach
really worth risking our butts?

00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:27.260
Mm.

00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:29.044
Your butt's in safe hands.

00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:34.571
If not, I'll be kicking yours.

00:30:37.705 --> 00:30:38.532
Hollis?

00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:42.231
Oh, just thought I'd check in
after you missed

00:30:42.405 --> 00:30:43.580
our beer session
the other night.

00:30:43.754 --> 00:30:45.191
I'm sorry, Hollis.

00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:47.193
I just got caught up
in a book. Dozed off.

00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:49.021
Coffee?

00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:50.283
Sure.

00:30:53.503 --> 00:30:55.941
So... seen the news lately?

00:30:56.115 --> 00:30:57.290
Can't miss the headlines

00:30:57.464 --> 00:30:58.987
about this war
they say is coming.

00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:01.294
There was a smaller story
yesterday

00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:03.122
about a tenement fire,

00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:05.602
and a highly unusual rescue.

00:31:10.694 --> 00:31:13.872
Nope. Nope.

00:31:14.046 --> 00:31:15.221
- Nope.
-  <i>Now, wait.</i>

00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:17.005
- Ah-ha.
<i>- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.615
<i>You're saying Dr. Manhattan</i>

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:20.922
<i>leaving the planet
was orchestrated?</i>

00:31:21.096 --> 00:31:22.402
Timed between the attacks

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:24.273
on Blake, Adrian,
and Rorschach, yes.

00:31:24.447 --> 00:31:26.232
It's too coincidental.

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:29.148
The cancer-scare media assault
on Jon had to be manufactured.

00:31:29.322 --> 00:31:30.627
<i>Laurie lived with him,</i>

00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:32.020
<i>and she never
contracted cancer.</i>

00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:33.674
<i>But I did some digging.</i>

00:31:33.848 --> 00:31:36.198
The cancer victims
mentioned in <i>Nova Express</i>

00:31:36.372 --> 00:31:38.766
were all employed at some point
by the same company.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.637
Again, too coincidental.

00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.031
I think somebody used
these specific people

00:31:43.205 --> 00:31:45.120
and the press
to prompt Jon's exile,

00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:47.209
and I think it's part of a plan

00:31:47.383 --> 00:31:49.995
to start World War III.

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:52.519
Whoa!
That's a long-shot theory.

00:31:52.693 --> 00:31:54.216
Laurie said as much, too.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.479
And this company,
connecting the cancer victims,

00:31:56.653 --> 00:31:57.480
who are they?

00:31:57.654 --> 00:31:58.742
And how do they connect

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:00.570
to Blake, Adrian,
and Rorschach?

00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:02.703
The company's called
Dimensional Developments.

00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:05.532
<i>Beyond the name,
I've hit a wall</i>

00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:07.795
<i>investigating their corporate structure.</i>

00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.188
<i>What about Adrian?</i>

00:32:09.362 --> 00:32:10.929
<i>He's connected
to the corporate world</i>

00:32:11.103 --> 00:32:11.973
<i>and would certainly
be motivated to help.</i>

00:32:12.147 --> 00:32:14.367
Without stronger evidence,

00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:16.978
sharing this conspiracy theory
with a man in his position

00:32:17.152 --> 00:32:18.893
might put him
in a compromising situation.

00:32:19.067 --> 00:32:22.810
I mean, he... he might
have to report us, but...

00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:24.377
but I'm working another lead

00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:27.162
that, uh, should break loose
very soon.

00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:29.817
I'm sure
you'll crack the case, kid.

00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:32.080
I believe in you.

00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:33.647
And thanks
for sharing the details.

00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:35.083
Mm.

00:32:35.257 --> 00:32:36.345
It feels like
the old days again.

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:39.435
Hey, we Nite Owls
have to stick together.

00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:42.525
Well, that's why
I paid a visit, Dan.

00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:44.658
If I can figure out
who made the rescue

00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:46.181
at the tenement fire,

00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:47.443
so can the police.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.232
Crap. We're out of time.

00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:26.656
Well, no going back now.

00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:29.529
If we don't crack this case,

00:33:29.703 --> 00:33:31.618
there may be no going back
for any of us.

00:33:36.492 --> 00:33:38.973
Go, go, go.
We got shots fired.

00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:40.496
Officer down!
South-west corner!

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.324
Surrender,
or you will be fired on!

00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:45.153
Aren't you glad
they keep you in solitary?

00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:47.068
Now our reunion
won't be interrupted

00:33:47.242 --> 00:33:48.939
by the mob out there.

00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:50.767
Lawrence, hurry up
with the arc welder.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.774
What's the matter, Rorschach?
Too warm in there?

00:33:57.948 --> 00:34:00.299
Well, it's gonna get
plenty warmer.

00:34:00.473 --> 00:34:02.127
Yeah. You notice how,
all of a sudden,

00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:04.868
he ain't giving you no,
"tall order, small world" shit?

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:07.262
Maybe he figured out
once we cut through these bars,

00:34:07.436 --> 00:34:09.003
we're gonna make him
a little shorter.

00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.352
Fat chance.

00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:12.485
Fat? You lousy bastard!

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.444
We got a jail full of guys
out here who hate your guts.

00:34:15.618 --> 00:34:16.619
What have you got?

00:34:16.793 --> 00:34:18.491
Your arms.

00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:19.883
Hey! What the hell?

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.494
Lawrence, you stupid
son of a bitch!

00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:22.538
Now we can't get to the lock.

00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:24.062
Sorry, Figure.

00:34:24.236 --> 00:34:25.411
Michael can still cut
through the bars.

00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:26.499
That'll take too long.

00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:27.804
This riot won't last,

00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:29.154
and I don't want
to be interrupted.

00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:30.503
- Sorry, Lawrence...
-  No!

00:34:30.677 --> 00:34:32.200
...but you're in the way
of my revenge.

00:34:32.374 --> 00:34:34.289
- No, boss!
- Michael, cut through him.

00:34:34.463 --> 00:34:36.813
- No, no, wait!
- Nothing personal, Larry.

00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:38.815
Wait! Hey!

00:34:46.823 --> 00:34:48.086
One-nothing.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.696
Your move.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.871
Come and get me.

00:34:56.006 --> 00:34:57.312
That thing
ain't one of ours.

00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:59.227
Open fire!

00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:01.055
Land your aircraft
or we will use deadly force.

00:35:01.229 --> 00:35:03.623
Police radio says this area
is controlled by prisoners.

00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:04.972
Ear plugs in.
Hitting the screechers.

00:35:09.977 --> 00:35:10.760
Ugh!

00:35:15.243 --> 00:35:16.201
Shoot that thing down!

00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:25.819
Hurry up with that lock.

00:35:25.993 --> 00:35:28.300
I wanna smell
this son of a bitch cooking.

00:35:28.474 --> 00:35:31.390
Then I'm gonna carve him up
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:33.479
We're in.

00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.482
Look at him

00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:39.354
climbing up onto his bed
like a scared kid.

00:35:39.528 --> 00:35:41.574
We got you now,
you little bastard.

00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:01.420
Never disposed of sewage
with toilet before.

00:36:01.594 --> 00:36:02.421
Obvious, really.

00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:04.510
Two-nothing.

00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:05.728
Your move.

00:36:16.478 --> 00:36:18.001
How will we find him
in all of this?

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:19.394
Assuming he's not dead.

00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:20.917
He attracts this horror
and madness.

00:36:21.091 --> 00:36:22.267
This is where he lives.

00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:25.444
Help! Somebody
get this guy! Help!

00:36:25.618 --> 00:36:26.923
Hey, Rorschach!

00:36:29.883 --> 00:36:30.797
Hey!

00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:31.754
Help!

00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:39.066
Rorschach!

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.676
Hey, man.
We came to bust you out.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.548
Excuse me.
I have to visit men's room.

00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:44.027
Oh, for Christ's sake!

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.986
Well, when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.466
Look,
we got masks in here!

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.989
That's Nite Owl! Get 'em!

00:36:49.163 --> 00:36:51.209
Hey! We are trying
to stop a war!

00:36:57.389 --> 00:37:00.914
Um... guess I'm kind
of bitter about...

00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:02.568
losing the house.

00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:03.656
I better radio the ship.

00:37:05.962 --> 00:37:07.094
Did what had to be done.

00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.096
Can leave now.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.532
- Are you sure?
- This way.

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:12.055
Did you wash your hands?

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.274
<i>Archie's</i>
covering our exit.

00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:14.188
Did you flush?

00:37:14.362 --> 00:37:14.884
Flushed twice.

00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:18.061
A little clogged.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.498
Don't let them escape!

00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:20.934
Track them
with the lights!

00:37:21.108 --> 00:37:22.544
Land your aircraft now!

00:37:22.718 --> 00:37:25.068
I repeat!
Land your aircraft!

00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:30.552
Everybody
will be looking for us up here.

00:37:30.726 --> 00:37:33.381
I know a place to hide
and plan our next move.

00:37:33.555 --> 00:37:35.470
Good seeing you
in uniform, Daniel.

00:37:35.644 --> 00:37:37.864
Like old times.

00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:40.345
Never liked your uniform,
Ms. Juspeczyk.

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:41.868
- Nothing personal.
- Ugh!

00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:43.739
Can't believe we agree
on something.

00:37:43.913 --> 00:37:46.438
Jesus.

00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:48.657
- Hello.
-  Jon.

00:37:48.831 --> 00:37:50.355
They said you were on Mars.

00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:51.921
I am on Mars.

00:37:52.095 --> 00:37:54.359
We have a conversation
scheduled there.

00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:56.361
You're going to try
to convince me

00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:58.624
to save this world.

00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:01.366
To-- I have to convince you?

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.630
Jon, we really need your help
here on Earth.

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:06.893
This is all
so <i>deus ex machina.</i>

00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:10.157
The god out of the machine.
Yes, I suppose it is.

00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:12.507
Nevertheless,

00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:14.814
an hour into the future,
we are on Mars talking.

00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:17.599
- Mars? We don't have time--
- Dan.

00:38:17.773 --> 00:38:19.427
I think
I'd better go with him.

00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:21.777
Maybe we'll find
a way out of this mess.

00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:23.170
I'll be okay.

00:38:23.344 --> 00:38:24.519
Laurie, wait.

00:38:24.693 --> 00:38:26.042
Take care.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.093
Pity they won't be
working with us.

00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:36.662
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:45.366
Here we are.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.541
What do you think?

00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:51.546
Oh, of course. Forgive me.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.201
Sometimes these things
slip my mind.

00:38:57.987 --> 00:38:59.206
Are you okay?

00:39:01.556 --> 00:39:04.516
Jesus! Jon,
you stupid son of a...

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:10.652
Holy shit.

00:39:10.826 --> 00:39:13.916
This is where
we debate Earth's destiny.

00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:25.885
<i>Truly, life is hell...</i>

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:30.803
<i>And death's rough hand,
our only deliverance.</i>

00:39:30.977 --> 00:39:34.676
<i>I would endure no more bubbling
dialogues from the dead.</i>

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.200
<i>No more ramblings
of damnation.</i>

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.507
<i>No more judgments
of our sins.</i>

00:39:41.509 --> 00:39:43.119
<i>...vigilante
known as Nite Owl,</i>

00:39:43.293 --> 00:39:44.120
<i>entered the riot
and freed suspected murderer,</i>

00:39:44.294 --> 00:39:45.470
<i>Walter Kovacs,</i>

00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:47.167
<i>also known as Rorschach.</i>

00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:49.561
<i>Both escaped police capture
by aircraft.</i>

00:39:49.735 --> 00:39:51.432
Argh!

00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:52.781
<i>More details
are still coming in.</i>

00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:54.348
- Goddamn it!
- Derf! What the hell?

00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:55.697
Hey, hey, hey.

00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:56.785
We don't want no trouble
around here.

00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.308
Shut up, old man.

00:39:58.483 --> 00:39:59.788
These super bastards
get away with everything

00:39:59.962 --> 00:40:01.616
while our guys
catch hell in that riot.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.444
It ain't fair!

00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:04.793
<i>Though
dreading such a black,</i>

00:40:04.967 --> 00:40:07.100
<i>breathless end, I leapt...</i>

00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:08.754
<i>Hey, the news guy
mentioned Nite Owl.</i>

00:40:08.928 --> 00:40:11.409
<i>...feet first into cold,</i>

00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:13.236
<i>dank mortality.</i>

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.369
Derf, he's the guy who wrote
that book about the masks.

00:40:15.543 --> 00:40:17.502
My dad takes his car
to his repair shop.

00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:19.112
- Do you know where that is?
- Yeah.

00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:20.722
It's just down the street...

00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.028
<i>But the ocean's depths</i>

00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:24.726
<i>refused to swallow me.</i>

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.816
<i>I lifted my uncomprehending
eyes to the heavens</i>

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.166
<i>and saw instead the earth.</i>

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.994
This guy likes
to play in riots...

00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:33.779
<i>I had reached my destination.</i>

00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.650
...so let's give him a riot.

00:40:35.824 --> 00:40:37.565
Yeah.
Yeah. Let's mess this guy up!

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:39.219
-  Hell, yeah!
- Bah!

00:40:39.393 --> 00:40:41.003
<i>They'd left me for dead.</i>

00:40:41.177 --> 00:40:44.354
<i>The fiends who'd doubtless
butchered my kin.</i>

00:40:44.529 --> 00:40:48.707
<i>But now I was returned
upon my corpse boat,</i>

00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:51.623
<i>a spectre of revenge,</i>

00:40:51.797 --> 00:40:54.364
<i>riding the flow tide home.</i>

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:55.975
Yeah! Yeah!

00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:58.238
- This it?
- Yeah. Upstairs.

00:41:05.375 --> 00:41:07.334
Okay, okay.
I hear you.

00:41:07.508 --> 00:41:08.988
You can quit banging.

00:41:09.162 --> 00:41:10.424
Just give me a second.

00:41:10.598 --> 00:41:11.512
- Get him!
- Yeah!

00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.863
Get that dog!

00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:16.474
Worry about yourself, scumbag.

00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:31.706
No.

00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:34.361
-  Derf!
-  Oh, man.

00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:36.058
Derf! That's enough!

00:41:36.232 --> 00:41:38.757
He's a goner.
We gotta get out of here!

00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:49.202
This is where
we hold our conversation.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.380
It commences when you
surprise me with the news

00:41:53.554 --> 00:41:55.382
that you and Dreiberg
are sleeping together.

00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:58.559
You... know about me and Dan?

00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:02.258
No. But in a few moments,
you're going to tell me.

00:42:02.432 --> 00:42:05.131
Ugh! Jon, I can't take
your predestination crap

00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:06.175
right now.

00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:07.655
It makes no sense

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:09.135
that you can be surprised
by anything

00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:11.920
when you can see time
in all directions.

00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:15.576
Everything is preordained,
even my responses.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.970
So the most powerful being
in the universe

00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:21.234
is just... a puppet
following a script?

00:42:21.408 --> 00:42:23.236
We are all puppets, Laurie.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.064
I am just a puppet
who can see the strings.

00:42:26.718 --> 00:42:29.634
There is no future.
There is no past.

00:42:29.808 --> 00:42:31.461
Time is simultaneous.

00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:34.552
Ugh! Jon, how can I debate
Earth's destiny

00:42:34.726 --> 00:42:36.249
when you know the outcome?

00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:38.033
Help me understand here.

00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:44.257
What was your
earliest memory?

00:42:45.737 --> 00:42:46.564
I don't know.

00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:50.132
When my folks split,
I guess.

00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:51.394
<i>He couldn't understand</i>

00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:52.874
<i>why I'd hold a grudge...</i>

00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:54.615
I remember them arguing,
but...

00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:57.009
<i>It's different for him.</i>

00:42:57.183 --> 00:42:59.489
<i>And I just couldn't
sustain the anger anymore.</i>

00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:01.143
<i>God! You need therapy.</i>

00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:03.711
No. It's gone.

00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:05.583
No. It is not.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.759
It is still here.

00:43:07.933 --> 00:43:09.412
Let yourself see it.

00:43:11.153 --> 00:43:12.415
<i>Look, for starters,</i>

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.243
<i>he was there, okay?</i>

00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:15.854
<i>And he was actually gentle.</i>

00:43:16.028 --> 00:43:18.639
I was five, I think.

00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:21.903
Do you have any idea
what gentleness means

00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:23.513
for a guy like that?

00:43:23.688 --> 00:43:24.863
<i>I snuck downstairs</i>

00:43:25.037 --> 00:43:26.865
<i>to play with a snow globe.</i>

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:28.954
It means
a broken marriage

00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:31.173
and an uncertain future
for our child.

00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:34.524
My child! That's what this
is all about, remember?

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:35.917
<i>My dad was always</i>

00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:37.353
<i>- yelling at me...</i>
- Laurel Jane!

00:43:37.527 --> 00:43:38.572
<i>...because he knew
I wasn't his.</i>

00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:39.878
What are you doing down here?

00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:44.143
Pretty sure my real dad
was Hooded Justice,

00:43:44.317 --> 00:43:45.927
my mom's old boyfriend.

00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:48.669
Anyway, I...

00:43:48.843 --> 00:43:50.932
My dad
was a domineering bully

00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:52.934
like most of the men
I've been...

00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:57.983
But Dan's... not like that.

00:43:58.766 --> 00:44:00.725
He's gentle.

00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:02.814
Someone you can pour
your troubles out to.

00:44:04.032 --> 00:44:06.208
A receptive lover.

00:44:06.382 --> 00:44:09.647
You mean...
you're sleeping with Dreiberg?

00:44:10.604 --> 00:44:12.650
But... you already know.

00:44:12.824 --> 00:44:14.477
- You said--
- I said many times

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:16.175
that you were my only link,

00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:18.394
my only concern
with the world.

00:44:18.568 --> 00:44:21.484
What does it say
that when you left me,

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:22.790
I left Earth?

00:44:22.964 --> 00:44:24.966
Now that you
have replaced me,

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.229
that link is shattered.

00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:31.364
Don't you see the futility
of asking me to save a world

00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:33.758
I no longer have
any stake in?

00:44:33.932 --> 00:44:36.282
Jon, don't be ridiculous.

00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:39.154
Earth's too important
to hinge on one relationship.

00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:40.590
Not to me.

00:44:40.765 --> 00:44:42.897
My red world here
means more to me

00:44:43.071 --> 00:44:44.594
than your blue one.

00:44:44.769 --> 00:44:46.466
I will show you.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.456
Cowering down here
in sludge

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.721
doing nothing but conjuring
names on screens.

00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:25.679
Computer unnecessary.

00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:28.769
This face is all I need.

00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:30.728
Give me smallest finger
on man's hand.

00:45:30.902 --> 00:45:33.295
I'll produce information
about mask killer.

00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.428
Hey, you needed
your spare costume,

00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:37.125
I needed time for research.

00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:39.780
And now we need to put
our heads together on this.

00:45:39.954 --> 00:45:42.000
You said the Comedian
told Moloch about an island

00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.349
and a plot against Jon,

00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:44.829
and I think the plot

00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:46.526
had to be the cancer-scare
media attack

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.962
that sent Jon off the planet.

00:45:48.136 --> 00:45:49.529
Now, check this out.

00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:51.052
I finally got a breakthrough

00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:52.967
investigating
Dimensional Developments,

00:45:53.141 --> 00:45:55.796
the company that employed
Jon's alleged cancer victims.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:57.319
They also owned

00:45:57.493 --> 00:45:58.973
the Institute
for Extraspatial Studies.

00:45:59.147 --> 00:46:01.236
And look, <i>Nova Express</i>
is connected.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.934
They published
the cancer list.

00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:05.371
And all of these companies
appear to be funded

00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.199
by Pyramid Deliveries.

00:46:07.373 --> 00:46:08.504
Pyramid?

00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:10.202
That means
something to you?

00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.639
<i>Moloch's illegal
cancer meds...</i>

00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:14.510
<i>delivered by Pyramid.</i>

00:46:14.684 --> 00:46:18.210
God, Moloch was in deep.
And probably didn't know it.

00:46:18.384 --> 00:46:19.994
If his place was bugged
by these companies...

00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:22.431
They'd know about
Comedian's visit to Moloch.

00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:24.651
And that Comedian discovered
the plot against Jon.

00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:26.305
Know of my investigation,

00:46:26.479 --> 00:46:28.002
know how to frame me.

00:46:28.176 --> 00:46:29.830
- But what about Veidt?
- Hm.

00:46:30.004 --> 00:46:32.528
The assassination attempt
on Adrian doesn't fit the--

00:46:32.702 --> 00:46:34.356
Hold... hold on.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.054
<i>Location
is Mason's Auto repairs.</i>

00:46:36.663 --> 00:46:37.969
Hollis?

00:46:38.143 --> 00:46:39.405
<i>Additional units needed</i>

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:40.623
<i>to canvass the area
for Knot-Tops.</i>

00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.016
<i>- Coroner en route.</i>
- No.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.757
<i>Body ID-ed as...</i>

00:46:43.931 --> 00:46:45.411
- No.
<i>- ...Hollis Mason.</i>

00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:46.499
Oh, God! Hollis?

00:46:46.673 --> 00:46:48.893
Oh, Christ! No!

00:46:49.458 --> 00:46:50.808
Sorry.

00:46:50.982 --> 00:46:52.113
He was a good man.

00:46:52.287 --> 00:46:53.941
I wasn't there.

00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:56.465
I should have...
I should have been there.

00:46:56.639 --> 00:46:57.815
It could be random killing.

00:46:57.989 --> 00:46:59.904
Could be
another mask killer.

00:47:00.078 --> 00:47:03.821
Squeeze underworld,
find answers. Take revenge.

00:47:03.995 --> 00:47:05.257
No.
We don't have time.

00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:06.345
We have to--

00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:07.868
His own fault.

00:47:08.042 --> 00:47:10.740
Was lazing too long.
Forgot how to do things.

00:47:10.915 --> 00:47:13.265
Lazing? Lazing?

00:47:13.439 --> 00:47:15.006
Who the hell
do you think you are?

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.747
You live off people
while insulting them.

00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:19.401
And the only reason
nobody complains

00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:22.100
is because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic!

00:47:27.018 --> 00:47:31.457
Do you know how hard
it is being your friend?

00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:38.943
Daniel, you are
a good friend.

00:47:39.639 --> 00:47:41.032
I know that.

00:47:41.206 --> 00:47:44.644
I'm sorry that
it is sometimes difficult.

00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:51.259
No. I'm the one
who should be sorry.

00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.608
Shouldn't have
said all that.

00:47:53.653 --> 00:47:54.915
Let's forget it, huh?

00:47:55.089 --> 00:47:56.743
We don't have time for this.

00:47:56.917 --> 00:47:59.050
Agreed. The end is nigh.

00:47:59.224 --> 00:48:00.616
And Adrian's assassin

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.836
is the next piece
of the puzzle.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.446
Let's hope
the world's smartest man

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.622
can help us
put it all together

00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:07.928
before it's too late.

00:48:19.244 --> 00:48:20.898
Mr. President,

00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:22.595
Russian tanks
are massing in East Germany

00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:24.814
in response to alleged
"Western alarmism."

00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:26.729
CIA thinks this is genuine.

00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:28.644
Both our countries have been
on full alert this past week.

00:48:28.818 --> 00:48:30.559
One spark
and it could all go up.

00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:33.258
Our analysis of a first strike
against their nuclear silos

00:48:33.432 --> 00:48:34.868
shows a good chance
of success.

00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:37.523
Casualties on our side
could be 10-20 million.

00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:39.177
Well, in the first wave, anyway.

00:48:39.351 --> 00:48:41.570
Our tactical and strategic
forces worldwide

00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:44.182
are standing by
on DEFCON 2.

00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:45.574
What are your instructions,
Mr. President?

00:48:45.748 --> 00:48:47.098
Hm.

00:48:48.186 --> 00:48:51.232
We sit, and we wait.

00:48:57.456 --> 00:49:02.026
Look, Jon. We don't have time
to go sightseeing on Mars,

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.506
and this debate
is going nowhere fast.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.639
Can you please
just spare me the agony

00:49:06.813 --> 00:49:08.728
and tell me
how this conversation ends?

00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:11.252
It ends in tears.

00:49:11.426 --> 00:49:14.038
I return to Earth
at some point in my future,

00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:16.431
and I find streets
full of corpses.

00:49:16.605 --> 00:49:19.043
But the details are vague.

00:49:19.217 --> 00:49:20.174
What?

00:49:20.348 --> 00:49:21.915
What do you mean "vague"?

00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:25.440
There is some kind of static
obscuring the future,

00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:28.182
preventing any clear
impression.

00:49:28.356 --> 00:49:31.229
The electromagnetic pulse
of mass warhead detonations

00:49:31.403 --> 00:49:32.752
could conceivably cause that.

00:49:32.926 --> 00:49:34.101
Oh, my God.

00:49:34.275 --> 00:49:36.669
Jon, we can't just
fly around Mars

00:49:36.843 --> 00:49:38.714
if missiles are about
to launch back home.

00:49:38.888 --> 00:49:41.804
Humanity might be on
the brink of extinction.

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.024
Doesn't that bother you?

00:49:44.198 --> 00:49:46.244
No, Laurie.
That does not bother me.

00:49:46.418 --> 00:49:50.030
Life is a highly overrated
phenomenon.

00:49:50.204 --> 00:49:54.339
Mars gets along perfectly
without a single microorganism.

00:49:54.513 --> 00:49:58.430
Its surface is a constantly
changing topographical map,

00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:03.870
flowing and shifting in ripples
10,000 years wide.

00:50:04.044 --> 00:50:06.481
It is called chaotic terrain.

00:50:06.655 --> 00:50:10.355
Yeah, well, our lives
have chaotic terrain, too.

00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:11.834
I mean, think about
when we first met

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.314
at that Crimebusters thing
in the '60s.

00:50:13.488 --> 00:50:14.663
...banding together
as the Crimebusters.

00:50:14.837 --> 00:50:16.491
It doesn't mean
squat!

00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.841
<i>Remember
how that all fell to pieces?</i>

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.974
<i>It was even more chaotic
after you left.</i>

00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:28.677
Laurel Jane, right?
Sally's kid?

00:50:29.983 --> 00:50:32.159
Uh... yeah.

00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:35.075
I caught your act in there.
You were pretty cool.

00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:38.513
Hm. You didn't grow up
too bad yourself.

00:50:38.687 --> 00:50:40.211
Thanks.

00:50:40.385 --> 00:50:43.083
Your, uh, mom
ever talk about me much?

00:50:43.257 --> 00:50:44.171
Mm, not really.

00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:45.999
Figures.

00:50:47.696 --> 00:50:49.568
You got her eyes,

00:50:49.742 --> 00:50:51.309
even that little mole.

00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:54.007
Ain't got her hair,
but otherwise you're like her.

00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:55.400
You're a looker.

00:50:55.574 --> 00:50:57.445
Take your hands off her!

00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:59.665
Hey, Sal.
Long time no see.

00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:01.580
Not long enough
in my book.

00:51:01.754 --> 00:51:03.799
Are there any depths
you won't sink to?

00:51:03.973 --> 00:51:06.411
We were just talking.
Can't a man talk to his...

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.890
his old friend's daughter?

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:09.283
What do you think I am?

00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.763
I know what you are,
Edward Blake!

00:51:10.937 --> 00:51:12.417
I've known for 25 years.

00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:14.810
And don't you
ever forget that.

00:51:14.984 --> 00:51:17.248
I thought we'd settled
all that a long time ago.

00:51:17.422 --> 00:51:19.293
Things like that
don't get settled,

00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.774
and they're not gonna happen
to my daughter.

00:51:21.948 --> 00:51:24.081
Come on.
We're leaving right now.

00:51:27.258 --> 00:51:29.390
<i>Of course,
in the moment,</i>

00:51:29.564 --> 00:51:31.436
<i>I didn't know
what that bastard had done.</i>

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.699
<i>Mom drove us three blocks...</i>

00:51:34.961 --> 00:51:36.528
...stopped the car,

00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:38.921
and then it all came
pouring out.

00:51:39.966 --> 00:51:43.317
Her pain, her fears,

00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:46.146
and what Blake did to her.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.236
I carried that with me
for years.

00:51:50.803 --> 00:51:54.198
At some point,
I crossed paths with Blake

00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:56.113
and a few too many drinks.

00:51:56.287 --> 00:51:58.202
<i>And I was a mean drunk.</i>

00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:00.552
Juspeczyk, huh?

00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:03.729
Took your grandmother's
name over Jupiter?

00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:06.340
I see you didn't take
your father's last name either.

00:52:06.514 --> 00:52:08.734
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

00:52:08.908 --> 00:52:11.693
Still see your mom in you.

00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:14.305
She was a peach.

00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:16.611
Is that what you told her
before you beat her,

00:52:16.785 --> 00:52:18.309
before you tried to rape her?

00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:20.354
What kind of a man
forces a woman into having sex

00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:21.442
against her will?

00:52:21.616 --> 00:52:25.707
Only... once.

00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:26.969
<i>With seven scotches in me,</i>

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:28.014
<i>and one in my hand,</i>

00:52:28.188 --> 00:52:29.450
<i>I let him have it.</i>

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:32.758
<i>And then,
you got angry,</i>

00:52:32.932 --> 00:52:33.846
<i>and teleported us out of there.</i>

00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:39.243
At least then
you seemed to understand

00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:42.202
the chaotic terrain
of our lives.

00:52:42.376 --> 00:52:44.073
Why does it matter less now?

00:52:44.987 --> 00:52:46.946
I read atoms, Laurie.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.687
I see the ancient spectacle

00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:51.080
that birthed the world
beneath us.

00:52:51.255 --> 00:52:55.520
Beside this, human life
is brief and mundane.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.359
I'm done.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.491
Land this thing.

00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:12.537
Take me home.

00:53:14.147 --> 00:53:15.235
As you wish.

00:53:37.475 --> 00:53:39.085
You said this would end
in tears.

00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:41.696
You were wrong.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.438
Maybe you're wrong about
streets full of corpses, too.

00:53:44.612 --> 00:53:47.398
Laurie, you complained
that I refused

00:53:47.572 --> 00:53:49.530
to see existence
in human terms.

00:53:49.704 --> 00:53:52.577
But you are refusing to see
through my viewpoint.

00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:54.231
If you would
just allow yourself

00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:56.363
to see the whole continuum,

00:53:56.537 --> 00:54:00.149
the patterns of life,
then you would understand.

00:54:00.324 --> 00:54:02.935
Instead, you deliberately
shut out understanding

00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:05.285
as if you are afraid.

00:54:05.459 --> 00:54:06.155
<i>Her pain...</i>

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.287
I'm not afraid.

00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:08.288
<i>And what Blake did to her.</i>

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.204
I'm just through
with looking back

00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:12.640
on my stupid memories.

00:54:12.814 --> 00:54:15.426
<i>I carried that
with me for years.</i>

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.079
I'm know what you are,
Edward Blake.

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:18.777
I've known for 25 years.

00:54:18.951 --> 00:54:20.431
What kind of a man
forces a woman into having sex

00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:21.780
against her will?

00:54:21.954 --> 00:54:24.348
What happened
was 40 years ago.

00:54:24.522 --> 00:54:27.699
- It's history.
- Only... once.

00:54:27.873 --> 00:54:29.396
I'm not afraid.

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:30.615
<i>Even the grimy
parts of it...</i>

00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:32.486
I'm not...

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.966
<i>...keep getting
brighter all the time.</i>

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:34.923
<i>God! You need therapy.</i>

00:54:35.097 --> 00:54:36.447
<i>My child!</i>

00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:37.317
<i>My dad was always</i>

00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:38.057
<i>yelling at me...</i>

00:54:38.231 --> 00:54:39.493
Laurel Jane!

00:54:39.667 --> 00:54:40.842
<i>...because he knew
it wasn't his.</i>

00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:42.627
Laurel Jane, right?
Sally's kid?

00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:45.630
Can't a man talk to his...
his old friend's daughter?

00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:47.980
He's...

00:54:48.154 --> 00:54:48.763
<i>You didn't grow up
too bad yourself.</i>

00:54:48.937 --> 00:54:49.808
He's not my...

00:54:49.982 --> 00:54:50.765
Still see your mom in you.

00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:52.332
You got her eyes.

00:54:52.506 --> 00:54:54.943
Your, uh, mom ever
talk about me much?

00:54:55.117 --> 00:54:56.597
No.

00:54:56.771 --> 00:54:57.511
<i>And I just couldn't sustain</i>

00:54:57.685 --> 00:54:58.686
<i>the anger anymore.</i>

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.297
<i>And he was actually gentle.</i>

00:55:00.471 --> 00:55:02.211
I thought we'd settled
all that a long time ago.

00:55:02.386 --> 00:55:03.691
<i>Getting old,</i>

00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.214
<i>you get
a different perspective.</i>

00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:06.868
<i>Can't a man
talk to his...</i>

00:55:07.042 --> 00:55:09.958
<i>...his old friend's daughter?</i>

00:55:13.048 --> 00:55:14.093
No.

00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:18.924
No!

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.187
No, no, no.

00:55:22.536 --> 00:55:24.190
Blake, you bastard!

00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:30.631
I will never, ever
call you my father!

00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:04.665
You're right.

00:56:06.624 --> 00:56:07.581
My life's a joke.

00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:12.151
My life... all life...

00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:14.675
meaningless.

00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.547
I disagree.

00:56:16.721 --> 00:56:18.810
What?

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:22.770
I do not think
your life is meaningless.

00:56:24.729 --> 00:56:27.514
But... why?

00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:30.517
You... changed my mind.

00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:33.694
For my entire existence,

00:56:33.868 --> 00:56:37.524
I have longed to see
a thermodynamic miracle,

00:56:37.698 --> 00:56:39.178
an event with odds

00:56:39.352 --> 00:56:41.223
so great against it
ever happening,

00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:44.357
that it is effectively
impossible

00:56:44.531 --> 00:56:48.056
like oxygen spontaneously
turning into gold.

00:56:48.927 --> 00:56:50.885
In every human coupling,

00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:55.455
a thousand-million sperms
vie for a single egg.

00:56:55.629 --> 00:56:58.719
Multiply those odds
by countless generations,

00:56:58.893 --> 00:57:01.809
against the odds
of your ancestors being alive,

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:03.463
meeting,

00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:05.900
siring this precise son,

00:57:06.074 --> 00:57:08.468
that exact daughter,

00:57:08.642 --> 00:57:12.037
until one day,
your mother loves a man

00:57:12.211 --> 00:57:14.822
she has every reason to hate.

00:57:14.996 --> 00:57:16.998
And out of that union,

00:57:17.172 --> 00:57:19.392
of the
thousand-million children

00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:21.307
competing for fertilization,

00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:23.265
it was you,

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.747
only you that emerged.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.969
To distill so specific a form

00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:33.711
from that chaos
of improbability,

00:57:33.885 --> 00:57:37.279
is like turning air
into gold.

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.369
<i>That is
the crowning unlikelihood,</i>

00:57:41.632 --> 00:57:44.635
<i>the thermodynamic miracle.</i>

00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:47.028
<i>But, if I'm...</i>

00:57:47.202 --> 00:57:51.424
<i>if my birth
is a thermodynamic miracle,</i>

00:57:51.598 --> 00:57:56.429
<i>you could say that about
anyone else in the world.</i>

00:57:56.603 --> 00:58:00.085
<i>Yes. The world
is so full of people,</i>

00:58:00.259 --> 00:58:02.653
<i>so crowded
with these miracles,</i>

00:58:02.827 --> 00:58:04.350
<i>that they become commonplace.</i>

00:58:05.307 --> 00:58:06.787
<i>And we forget...</i>

00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:10.965
<i>I forget what they truly are.</i>

00:58:12.576 --> 00:58:16.057
<i>Now, from your vantage point,</i>

00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:17.711

<i>and unpredictable beyond

00:58:46.479 --> 00:58:48.829
Not like him.
Building deserted.

00:58:49.003 --> 00:58:52.137
- Works here late every night.
- Found his daily planner.

00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:56.489
Yesterday's entry...
"Leave for Karnak."

00:58:56.663 --> 00:58:59.013
That's his private base
in the Antarctic.

00:58:59.187 --> 00:59:00.972
So much
for asking him for help.

This chart,

00:59:05.063 --> 00:59:08.109
War, famine,
environmental decline.

00:59:08.283 --> 00:59:10.198
Crisis lines converge
mid '90s.

00:59:10.372 --> 00:59:11.678
Optimistic.

00:59:11.852 --> 00:59:13.637
Crisis arrives decade early,

00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:15.334

00:59:20.252 --> 00:59:21.470

He owns and controls
all of them.

00:59:41.186 --> 00:59:42.753
But Veidt was target
of assassin.

00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:46.104
Maybe, maybe not.

00:59:46.278 --> 00:59:48.672

<i>Not enough

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.901
Hello, Mr. Veidt.

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.077
You'll be happy to know

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.646
Excellent news, my friends.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.127

<i>Ah. Ramses II,

<i>Tell us more about your path

<i>Oh, certainly.</i>

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:51.838
<i>I'd say my journey began
after my parents died.</i>

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:53.448
<i>They left me
with a lot of money,</i>

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:56.016
<i>but I gave it all to charity
when I was 17.</i>

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:59.541
<i>I wanted to prove that I could
accomplish anything I wanted...</i>

-  No.

<i>...only guidance

The planet is currently
swarming in events,

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:34.054
and I need
to review them all.

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:37.014
I need information
in its most concentrated form.

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.929
<i>...where some say

Yes.

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:50.375
<i>Alexander united
the civilized world...</i>

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:51.550
All alone.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:52.594
<i>But only while he lived.</i>

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.161
Just me and the world.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.119
<i>The wisdom

<i>for generations
beyond their passing.</i>

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:00.080
<i>Adopting Ramses II's
Greek name,</i>

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.647
<i>and Alexander's
free-booting style,</i>

01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:04.693
<i>I began my path...
to conquest.</i>

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.913
<i>Conquest not of men,</i>

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:08.872
<i>but the evils
that beset them.</i>

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.360
The channels change
every 100 seconds

01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:21.362
creating random images,

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:23.060
allowing subliminal hints
of the future

01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:24.452
to come through.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.890
A jigsaw puzzle model
of tomorrow.

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:28.630
I see a juxtaposition

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.677
of wish-fulfillment violence
and infantile imagery,

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:37.683
evocative of desire to regress,
be free of responsibility.

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:40.904
I see increased sexual imagery,
implying an erotic undercurrent

01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:42.906
not uncommon
in times of conflict.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.560
This all says war.

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:50.783
I will invest accordingly.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:56.484
Everybody's scared.
You can feel it.

01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:57.964
<i>I estimated</i>

01:03:58.138 --> 01:03:59.531
<i>I was not far
from Davidstown...</i>

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:01.446
Just waiting for the nukes
to start dropping.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.969
<i>I was sure that by now</i>

01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:04.405
<i>the place had been overrun</i>

01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:05.972
<i>by the</i> Freighter's <i>brigands.</i>

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.844
<i>At the end of my journey,</i>

01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:11.412
<i>all that remained to me now
was revenge</i>

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:15.808
<i>against those who had killed
my family, my crew,</i>

01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:17.941
<i>and left me for dead.</i>

01:04:19.638 --> 01:04:20.769
<i>Davidstown
slept,</i>

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:24.121
<i>deserted save for silence.</i>

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.601
Hard to believe
we're finally going home.

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:28.386
I'll drink to that.

01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:33.826
<i>I arrived
at my former residence,</i>

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.308
<i>careful not to rouse the
butchers occupying it.</i>

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.623
<i>Unaware that
death was among them...</i>

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:54.760
<i>They'd know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.</i>

01:04:57.328 --> 01:04:59.069
<i>One, however, was awake.</i>

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.463
<i>Frantic, lest he should
raise alarms,</i>

01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:03.725
<i>I set upon him.</i>

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.553
<i>In cataract darkness,</i>

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:07.077
<i>I bludgeoned him.</i>

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:09.906
<i>His screams
unnervingly shrill.</i>

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.866
<i>No pirates came,
but something worse.</i>

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.695
<i>I looked up
into faces familiar,</i>

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:18.697
<i>save for their terror.</i>

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:21.091
<i>The children wailed.</i>

01:05:21.265 --> 01:05:23.528
<i>I looked
down at the figure beneath me.</i>

01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:28.359
<i>Through puffed and bloodied
lips she mouthed my name.</i>

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:31.275
<i>There came an understanding
so large,</i>

01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:35.453
<i>it left no room for sanity.</i>

01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:40.675
<i>I ran, but the knowledge
of my damnation paced me,</i>

01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:45.158
<i>gloating, celebrating
its awful victory.</i>

01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:48.292
<i>Behind me,
a Lynch mob howled.</i>

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:52.165
<i>Eventually, I came
to an ash-colored shore,</i>

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:55.821
<i>a dismal black ocean
stretching before me.</i>

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:59.912
<i>How had I reached this
appalling position,</i>

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:03.568
<i>with love, only love, as my
guide?</i>

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:06.745
<i>How had my noble intentions,</i>

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:08.965
<i>led me to atrocity?</i>

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:25.068
<i>Pausing,
I stood, panting, sobbing,</i>

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.244
<i>...listening to
the windborne sound</i>

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:30.421
<i>of my pursuers draw closer.</i>

01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:36.731
<i>Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.</i>

01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:40.953
<i>The black freighter and its
accursed inhabitants</i>

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:44.739
<i>seemed to be waiting,
waiting for me.</i>

01:06:44.913 --> 01:06:46.524
<i>They'd come to Davidstown</i>

01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:49.527
<i>to collect the only prize
they'd ever valued.</i>

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:53.183
<i>Claim the only soul
they'd ever truly wanted.</i>

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:56.621
<i>I was a horror,</i>

01:06:56.795 --> 01:07:00.929
<i>amongst horrors I must dwell.</i>

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.584
<i>I swam towards the
anchored freighter.</i>

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.457
<i>A rope snaked down.</i>

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:10.504
<i>Spluttering, I grabbed it.</i>

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:13.246
<i>And from the decks above,
a cheer went up,</i>

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:17.990
<i>both gross and black.</i>

01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:21.559
<i>It's stench
affronting heaven.</i>

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:42.275
Manners.

01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:49.674
Now.

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.416
What can I do for you?

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.506
We know
you're behind everything.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.335
The Comedian's murder,
Jon's exile.

01:07:58.509 --> 01:07:59.640
Christ! Adrian,

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:00.859
we're on the brink
of World War III

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:02.339
because of you.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.210
Well, Nixon
and his attack dog, Blake,

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:06.473
most certainly did more
in that regard.

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.040
Have you ever read
the last speech

01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:09.302
Kennedy was supposed
to deliver?

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:18.181
"We in this country,
in this generation,

01:08:18.355 --> 01:08:21.836
are by destiny,
rather than by choice,

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.709
the watchmen
on the walls of freedom."

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:28.887
But in a world of tyranny,
crosshairs watched him.

01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:30.323
Blake's, most probably.

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:31.411
What the hell

01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:32.760
are you getting at, Adrian?

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:34.849
It was then
that I began to realize

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:37.113
my adventuring
was a...

01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:39.767
hollow crusade
against such forces,

01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:42.466
a dark comedy clarified
by the Comedian himself

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.294
in '66.

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:47.253
<i>I'm sure you remember
the Crimebusters fiasco,</i>

01:08:47.427 --> 01:08:49.777
<i>where he discussed
nuclear war's inevitability.</i>

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.433
<i>He opened my eyes
to the truth.</i>

01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:55.653
<i>Only the best comedians
accomplish that.</i>

01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:59.352
<i>That's when I understood
what I must do.</i>

01:08:59.526 --> 01:09:02.268
Alexander's methods,
unification by conquest

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:03.661
would not halt the race

01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:04.879
toward mutually-assured
destruction

01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.794
between East and West.

01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:08.361
But Alexander was also known

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:11.277
for untying the unsolvable
Gordian knot...

01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:13.932
by severing it with a sword.

01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:15.803
The same
unconventional solution

01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:17.153
would be required

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.589
to untangle
our global problems.

01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:20.721
And my sword

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:23.202
would be history's
greatest practical joke.

01:09:23.376 --> 01:09:25.552
A joke discovered
by Comedian.

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.730
Blake was returning
from Nicaragua by airship

01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:31.993
when he spotted
my private island.

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:34.996
<i>He investigated and discovered
my artists and scientists</i>

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.696
<i>creating a genetically-altered,
monstrous new life-form</i>

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.350
<i>and our research
in teleportation.</i>

01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:42.743
Teleportation?

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.571
But only Jon can teleport.

01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:47.487
Jon proved it possible,
and certainly more desirable

01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:49.489
than the electric vehicles
he developed.

01:09:49.663 --> 01:09:51.926
<i>So, I capitalized
on his endeavors</i>

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.060
<i>by developing the basic patent
for the public spark-hydrants</i>

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.975
<i>that power his vehicles.</i>

01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:58.977
<i>I financed
Dimensional Developments,</i>

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.935
<i>and the Institute
for Extraspatial Studies</i>

01:10:01.109 --> 01:10:02.154
<i>with the proceeds.</i>

01:10:02.328 --> 01:10:04.461
Both developed new technologies

01:10:04.635 --> 01:10:07.333
spun-off from Jon's
government research.

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:09.640
But without his guiding mind,

01:10:09.814 --> 01:10:12.773
teleportation proved...
limited.

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:15.298
Anything living
died explosively on arrival.

01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:17.125
Talking in circles.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.563
You murdered Comedian
to keep him quiet.

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.129
Unfortunately for Blake,

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.131
<i>I was monitoring
Moloch's residence</i>

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:25.960
<i>when his practiced
cynicism cracked,</i>

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:29.007
<i>and he began to spill fragments
of my plan.</i>

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.705
<i>I regret
his accidental involvement.</i>

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:34.926
<i>With the fate of the world,
and all humanity at stake,</i>

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.798
<i>I couldn't risk the possibility
of Blake revealing my plan</i>

01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:40.801
<i>in its entirety to anyone...</i>

01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:42.194
...especially to Jon.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.240
Being too powerful

01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:46.503
and unpredictable
to fit my plans,

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:48.722
<i>I plotted his removal
for years.</i>

01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:50.681
<i>Thus his past associates</i>

01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.683
<i>were exposed to radiation
and cultivated as weapons</i>

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:56.817
<i>against Jon's increasingly
fragile attachment to mankind.</i>

01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.342
<i>With Jon and Blake
neutralized,</i>

01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:02.997
<i>your mask-killer investigation
then needed stopping.</i>

01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.086
<i>I staged
my own assassination attempt</i>

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.612
<i>to place me beyond suspicion
and cast doubt on the theory.</i>

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:11.963
<i>The unwitting assassin I hired
was fed a cyanide capsule.</i>

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:14.705
<i>And Rorschach was framed
for Moloch's murder</i>

01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:16.228
<i>to close the loose ends.</i>

01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:21.015
Adrian, you're talking about
faulty teleportation

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:24.062
and genetic monsters
and ending war.

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:27.892
How does any of this
mad science make sense?

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:29.850
My plan is quite simple.

01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:31.939
Teleport my creature
to New York.

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.942
The ensuing explosion
will wipe out half the city.

01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:37.249
The aftermath will convince
the governments of Earth

01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:40.034
that we are under attack
by beings from another world.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:42.123
Instead of fighting
each other,

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.604
for the first time
the human race will unite

01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:46.084
against a common foe

01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:49.783
and usher in a new age
of global peace.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.050
Adrian, listen to me.

01:11:56.747 --> 01:11:58.139
You're not well.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.663
You need help.

01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:01.317
I'm just glad we got here

01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:03.362
before you had a chance
to try and do it.

01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.582
Do it?

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:08.454
Dan, I'm not
some comic book villain.

01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:10.891
Do you seriously think
I'd explain my masterstroke

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.806
if there was even
the slightest chance of you

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.286
affecting its outcome?

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.984
I did it 35 minutes ago.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:35.742
Oh, man.

01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:38.092
Hm.

01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:44.708
Well, it's 11:25.
About time to close up, kid.

01:12:44.882 --> 01:12:47.319
Hey, how many times
you gonna read that junk?

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:49.452
This story
don't make sense, man.

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.105
That's why I got
to read it over.

01:12:51.279 --> 01:12:54.021
And my name's Bernie,
not "kid."

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.806
Bernie?
Short for Bernard?

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.373
No kidding.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:58.635
That's my name... too.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:00.201
Whoa...

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:09.254
What the...

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.777
Ah, Jesus, Derf...

01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:19.960
Holy...

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.850
Oh, my God!

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:25.896
Oh, my God!

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:35.122
What... what the hell is that?

01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:38.430
I had expected us to return
to Earth much earlier.

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:40.432
The interference I had noticed,

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.782
it was not a warhead detonation
after all.

01:14:43.696 --> 01:14:44.784
So what...

01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:46.960
Tachyons.

01:14:47.134 --> 01:14:48.614
A squall of tachyons.

01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:50.790
But where can they be
coming from?

01:14:50.964 --> 01:14:54.315
I had almost forgotten
the delights of uncertainty.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.230
Jon...

01:14:56.404 --> 01:14:59.364
I am picking up a strong pulse
from the south-polar region.

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:01.322
Jon, get me out of here, please.

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:03.455
Of course.

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:08.634
<i>No one will doubt</i>

01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:11.768
<i>the Earth has met a force
so dreadful</i>

01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:13.683
<i>that it must be repelled,</i>

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:17.121
<i>all former enmities aside.</i>

01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:21.691
No one must ever
know the truth.

01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:24.520
Those who were involved
are dead.

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:28.611
Killers killed by killers
who killed each other.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.438
A lethal pyramid.

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.573
And what about us?

01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:42.189
Veidt, of course.

01:15:42.363 --> 01:15:45.366
Who else has the intelligence
for tachyon interference?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.064
He must have anticipated

01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:49.196
my possible discovery
of his plot for some time.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.548
All that stuff in New York,
Adrian planned it?

01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:55.376
Yes. He killed Blake
and half of New York.

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:57.814
Excuse me, Rorschach.

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:00.120
I am informing Laurie
ten seconds ago.

01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:02.209
These tachyons are muddling
things up.

01:16:02.383 --> 01:16:03.341
Jon, wait!

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:09.129
-  Jon!
-  No!

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:10.522
Have to stop him.

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:12.176
Killed Blake
and half of New York.

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:14.787
Yes. He killed Blake
and half of New York.

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:16.267
Excuse me, Rorschach.

01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:18.661
I am informing Laurie
ten seconds ago.

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:21.925
These tachyons
are muddling things up.

01:16:31.238 --> 01:16:33.545
The static is stronger here.

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:38.637
Hiding behind these tachyons
was clever, Veidt.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:41.379
But this game is stupid.

01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:45.644
Very well.

01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:47.428
If I must follow this through
to the bitter end...

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.927
Dan.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.854
Bubastis, forgive me.

01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:28.644
Veidt, don't!

01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:42.483
Huh. I wasn't actually sure
that would work.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:43.571
Veidt...

01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:46.879
you're an asshole.

01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:02.721
Oh, shit.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.682
Laurie!

01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:11.904
Something else I wasn't sure
I would--

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.217
I am disappointed, Veidt.

01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:21.914
Very disappointed.

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:39.453
Restructuring myself
was the first trick I learned.

01:18:39.627 --> 01:18:41.455
Did you really think
it would kill me?

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.068
I have walked across the sun.

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:47.810
I have seen events
so tiny and so fast

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:50.638
that they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all.

01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:51.552
But you?

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.381
You are just a man.

01:18:54.555 --> 01:18:56.906
And this world's smartest man

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.605
means nothing more to me
than its smartest termite.

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:04.261
What is that, Veidt?

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:06.437
Another ultimate weapon?

01:19:06.611 --> 01:19:08.569
You could say that.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:09.701
<i>This just in...</i>

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:10.920
<i>We have terrifying images...</i>

01:19:11.094 --> 01:19:13.226
Oh, Christ...

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.098
<i>What you are about to see
may shock you.</i>

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:17.143
<i>...it's an utterly
horrible scene here.</i>

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:19.929
<i>...an institute
researching other dimensions.</i>

01:19:20.103 --> 01:19:21.844
<i>...millions have
died here this evening.</i>

01:19:22.018 --> 01:19:24.716
No! No!

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.283
<i>Could it be alien contact?</i>

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.937
<i>Has the Earth been invaded?</i>

01:19:28.111 --> 01:19:29.460
<i>Global concern is growing...</i>

01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:31.244
<i>...and world leaders
are issuing</i>

01:19:31.418 --> 01:19:32.985
<i>statements of support
across the globe.</i>

01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:34.378
<i>We're hearing now
that Russian leader</i>

01:19:34.552 --> 01:19:36.249
<i>Gorbachev said,</i>

01:19:36.423 --> 01:19:38.121
<i>they're evaluating the new
threat in New York...</i>

01:19:38.295 --> 01:19:40.427
<i>...increasing calls
for an immediate peace summit</i>

01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:42.125
<i>in Geneva from world leaders...</i>

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:44.040
<i>in a global
concerted effort...</i>

01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:45.955
<i>Even Russia
is suspending military action.</i>

01:19:46.129 --> 01:19:48.218
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is good news.</i>

01:19:48.392 --> 01:19:49.610
<i>The war is over.</i>

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.438
<i>War is over.</i>

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.136
<i>The war is over.</i>

01:19:54.311 --> 01:19:56.617
I did it. I did it!

01:19:57.705 --> 01:20:00.708
I saved Earth from hell!

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:03.886
And next I will lift her up
toward utopia.

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.626
Wait. Next?

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.194
You really think
you can get away with this?

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:13.069
If you expose me,

01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:16.159
you will undo the peace
that millions died to achieve.

01:20:17.073 --> 01:20:18.770
If you kill me,

01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:21.338
you risk investigations
that will reveal what happened.

01:20:22.774 --> 01:20:25.037
He is correct.

01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:26.647
Exposing this plot

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.390
results in greater destruction
on Earth.

01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:34.090
On Mars,
you demonstrated life's value.

01:20:34.264 --> 01:20:38.355
If we would preserve life here,
we must remain silent.

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:43.969
You're right. Jesus.

01:20:50.715 --> 01:20:51.716
Rorschach...

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.850
we... we...

01:20:57.156 --> 01:20:59.158
We have to compromise on this.

01:21:02.031 --> 01:21:04.250
No.

01:21:04.424 --> 01:21:06.600
Not even
in the face of Armageddon.

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:08.428
Never compromise.

01:21:11.127 --> 01:21:14.173
Well, in all likelihood,
he is of no consequence.

01:21:14.347 --> 01:21:17.133
Rorschach is hardly
a reliable witness.

01:21:18.525 --> 01:21:19.526
Still...

01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:26.316
I think I shall meditate
in my orrery now.

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:28.405
Jon?

01:21:39.068 --> 01:21:40.199
Where are you going?

01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:41.766
Back to America.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.421
People must be told.
Evil must be punished.

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:47.250
You know,
I cannot let you do that.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.212
Of course.
To protect Veidt's new utopia.

01:21:53.386 --> 01:21:55.606
One more body
amongst foundations

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.347
makes little difference.

01:21:58.783 --> 01:21:59.610
Well...

01:22:01.351 --> 01:22:02.395
what are you waiting for?

01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.007
Do it.

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:08.924
Rorschach...

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:14.930
Do it.

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:20.457
Do it!

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.116
No!

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.292
- No, no.
- Dan.

01:22:30.032 --> 01:22:30.815
God.

01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:32.077
I'm here, Dan.

01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:33.470
No.

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:34.906
I'm so sorry.

01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:50.226
Hello, Jon.

01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:53.751
I was hoping
we'd have a chance to talk.

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:58.277
I know I've journeyed
across the backs

01:22:58.451 --> 01:23:00.976
of murdered innocents
to save humanity.

01:23:02.325 --> 01:23:03.891
But someone
had to take the weight

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:07.547
of that awful necessary crime.

01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:10.811
Unlike Rorschach,
I understand,

01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:14.815
without condoning
or condemning.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:19.081
Human affairs cannot
be my concern any longer.

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:24.390
I am leaving this galaxy
for one... less complicated.

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:27.437
But you'd regained interest
in human life.

01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:29.656
Yes, I have.

01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:33.269
I think I would like
to create some.

01:23:35.575 --> 01:23:36.315
Goodbye, Adrian.

01:23:36.489 --> 01:23:37.838
Before you leave,

01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:41.233
I did the right thing,
didn't I?

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.149
It all worked out in the end.

01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:47.065
In the end?

01:23:48.632 --> 01:23:50.416
Nothing ends, Adrian.

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.377
Nothing ever ends.

01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:16.747
Well, despite
nearly killing me

01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:18.575
with a heart attack,

01:24:18.749 --> 01:24:21.186
this is quite a Christmas gift.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.451
I'm just so happy
to have my little Laurel back.

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:28.585
- Hair color, aside.
- Mother, remember?

01:24:28.759 --> 01:24:30.761
It's Sandra
and Sam Hollis, now.

01:24:30.935 --> 01:24:32.545
Aw!

01:24:32.719 --> 01:24:36.027
And Hollis would be so proud
that you took his name.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:39.596
It was the least I could do
to honor him.

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.772
He was like
a second father to me.

01:24:41.946 --> 01:24:44.644
And that's why
I wanted to visit.

01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:50.781
Mom, I found out
who my real dad was.

01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:54.524
Oh, Jesus.

01:24:54.698 --> 01:24:57.309
Oh, Laurel.
I'm so sorry.

01:24:57.483 --> 01:24:58.919
Mom...

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.618
- What you must think...
- Mom, it doesn't matter.

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:06.884
People's lives
take them strange places.

01:25:07.928 --> 01:25:09.321
They do strange things,

01:25:09.495 --> 01:25:11.367
and sometimes
they can't talk about them.

01:25:13.499 --> 01:25:14.587
I know how that is.

01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:20.332
I love you, Mom.

01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:23.248
You never did anything
wrong by me.

01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:31.038
Bye, Sam. Bye, Sandra.

01:25:31.213 --> 01:25:32.823
And don't wait too long
to have children.

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:34.303
I'm an old woman.

01:25:34.477 --> 01:25:36.783
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye, Ms. Jupiter.

01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:38.089
You know, maybe that wasn't

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:39.656
such a bad idea
of your mother's-

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:41.179
Forget it.

01:25:41.353 --> 01:25:42.789
Not yet.

01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:44.269
You've been talking about
adventuring again,

01:25:44.443 --> 01:25:46.053
and I'm not staying home
changing diapers.

01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:50.275
Nite Owl and Silk Spectre
sounds pretty awesome.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:52.756
- I think I want a new name.
- Mm?

01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:54.975
And a better costume
for protection.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.891
- Mm-hm.
- Something leather.

01:25:58.065 --> 01:25:59.197
Sure.

01:25:59.371 --> 01:26:00.633
And a mask.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:02.548
Uh...

01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:04.594
-  Maybe a gun.
-  Mm...

01:26:12.079 --> 01:26:13.080
Seymour,
where have you been?

01:26:13.255 --> 01:26:14.778
Dimension X?

01:26:14.952 --> 01:26:15.866
I just got lunch
from Burgers 'n' Borscht.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.433
Don't say it!

01:26:17.607 --> 01:26:19.043
I won't have Russian
spoken in this office,

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:20.827
ass-kissing peace accord
or not.

01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:22.525
What are you doing?

01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:24.266
Well, I was gonna
eat my lunch.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.702
Three million New Yorkers died,

01:26:25.876 --> 01:26:26.920
and you weren't one of them.

01:26:27.094 --> 01:26:28.618
Seymour, damn it!

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:30.837
You've got two more pages
to fill before you eat.

01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:31.882
I thought
your column--

01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:33.318
Well, you thought wrong.

01:26:33.492 --> 01:26:35.059
Nobody's allowed
to say bad things

01:26:35.233 --> 01:26:37.017
about our "good old buddies,"
the Russians anymore.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.932
So bang goes
a two-page column.

01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:40.064
Get some filler somewhere.

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:41.718
Robert Redford says

01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:43.372
he'll be running for president
in '88.

01:26:43.546 --> 01:26:45.374
Seymour,
do not dignify absurdities

01:26:45.548 --> 01:26:47.071
with coverage.

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:49.160
Nobody wants a cowboy actor
in the White House.

01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:51.118
Then I guess
it's something

01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.468
from the crank file?

01:26:52.642 --> 01:26:54.121
Yes, yes.

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:56.602
Whatever's within
your limited abilities.

01:26:56.776 --> 01:27:00.084
Just take responsibility
for once in your life.

01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:02.129
Run whatever you want.

01:27:02.304 --> 01:27:05.829
I leave it entirely
in your hands.

01:27:08.179 --> 01:27:11.182
